# S-BYOD ONOS Application
This Application creates personalized virtual networks for each device of a user.
They are extended on demand, which is done once the user authenticates, activates
access to additional applications, or as soon as applications scale out.
The virtual networks are adapted while the user is roaming with his device through the network.

The authentication can be realized with the [S-BYOD Portal] providing the code for
the Web-Portal, where BYOD services are enabled and disabled.

#### Note
The S-BYOD Application is an extension of the [ONOS] project.
Therefore a running ONOS instances is a pre-condition to start this application.
